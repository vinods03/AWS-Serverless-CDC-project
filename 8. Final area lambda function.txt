The lambda function on the final area has a trigger on the final area SQS queue.
When a file arrives at the final area S3 bucket, an event notification is sent to the final area queue.
This lambda function then captures the file details like file name, file size, file etag etc. of the arrived file and makes an entry into the DynamoDB audit table.
This lambda function also triggers a Glue Crawler so that the final data can be queried on Athena.

Refer Code/lambda-final-area-fn for the code.
Make sure the laambda function has the privileges to read from the SQS queue, write into DynamoDB table and also to trigger Glue crawler.
Change the timeout to 3 minutes, on the SQS trigger set the batch window to 1 minute and in the final area SQS queue, set the visibility timeout to 5 minutes.
